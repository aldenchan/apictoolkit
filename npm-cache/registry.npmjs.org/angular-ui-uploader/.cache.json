ui-uploader [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/angular-ui/ui-uploader.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/angular-ui/ui-uploader) [![npm

version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/angular-ui-uploader.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/bo/angular-ui-uploader) [![Join the chat at

is a single/multiple and high customizable file uploader and the most important is very easy to implement.\n\n  - Upload multiple or single files\n  - Cancel or remove upload when you want.\n  - Allows concurrent Upload\n  - Totally cutomizable\n\nYou can use with html5, jquery or every library or framework:\n\n> The main objective of ui-uploader is\n>  to have a user control, clean, simple, customizable,\n> and above all very easy to implement.\n\nTry the [demo](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-uploader/master/demo/index.html).\n\n\nCompatibility\n-------------\n\nBecause this project uses [FormData](http://caniuse.com/#search=formdata), it does **not** work on IE9 or earlier.\n\n## Requirements\n\n- AngularJS\n\n## Usage\n\n\nYou can get it from [Bower](http://bower.io/)\n\n```sh\nbower install angular-ui-uploader\n```\n\nLoad the script files in your application:\n\n```html\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/angular/angular.js\"></script>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"bower_components/angular-ui-uploader/dist/uploader.js\"></script>\n```\n\nAdd the specific module to your dependencies:\n\n```javascript\nangular.module('myApp', ['ui.uploader', ...])\n```\n\nNow you can use the ui-uploader methods.\n\n```javascript\n$uiUploader.addFiles(files);\n$uiUploader.remove(file);\n$uiUploader.removeAll();\n```\n\nConfigure ui-uploader callbacks and start!\n\n```javascript\n$uiUploader.startUpload({\n                url: 'http://my_domain.com',\n                concurrency: 2,\n                onProgress: function(file) {\n                    // file contains a File object\n                    console.log(file);\n                },\n                onCompleted: function(file, response) {\n                    // file contains a File object\n                    console.log(file);\n                    // response contains the server response\n                    console.log(response);\n                }\n                onCompletedAll: function(files) {\n                \t// files is an array of File objects\n                \tconsole.log(files);\n                }\n            });\n```\n\nPerform CORS AJAX requests by setting the options.withCredentials flag to true!\n\n```javascript\n$uiUploader.startUpload({\n                url: 'http://my_domain.com/path/to/api-endpoint',\n                options: {\n                \twithCredentials: true\n                },\n                onProgress: function(file) {\n                    //do stuff\n                },\n                onCompleted: function(file, response) {\n                    // do stuff\n                }\n                onCompletedAll: function(files) {\n                \t// do stuff\n                }\n            });\n```\n\nConfigure custom request headers by options.headers field\n\n```javascript\n$uiUploader.startUpload({\n                url: 'http://my_domain.com',\n                concurrency: 2,\n                headers: {\n                    'Accept': 'application/json'\n                },\n                onCompletedAll: function(files) {\n                \t// files is an array of File objects\n                \tconsole.log(files);\n                }\n            });\n```\n\n## Development\n\nWe use Karma and jshint to ensure the quality of the code.  The easiest way to run these checks is to use grunt:\n\n```sh\nnpm install -g gulp-cli\nnpm install && bower install\ngulp\n```\n\nThe karma task will try to open Firefox and Chrome as browser in which to run the tests.  Make sure this is available or change the configuration in `karma.conf.js`\n\n\n### Gulp watch\n\n`gulp watch` will automatically test your code and build a release whenever source files change.\n\n### How to release\n\nUse gulp to bump version, build and create a tag. Then push to GitHub:\n\n````sh\ngulp release [--patch|--minor|--major]\ngit push --tags origin master # push everything to GitHub\n````\n\nTravis will take care of testing and publishing to npm's registry (bower will pick up the change automatically). Finally [create a release on GitHub](https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-uploader/releases/new) from the tag created by Travis.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"powerkiki","email":"adrien.crivelli@gmail.com"},{"name":"proloser","email":"deansofer@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2016-10-17T11:31:54.299Z","created":"2015-07-01T06:28:21.463Z","1.0.0":"2015-07-01T06:28:21.463Z","1.1.0":"2015-08-04T05:14:07.342Z","1.1.1":"2015-08-05T02:15:54.152Z","1.1.2":"2015-10-27T03:11:56.236Z","1.1.3":"2015-12-01T00:57:10.722Z","1.2.0":"2016-10-14T11:09:53.363Z","1.2.1":"2016-10-17T11:31:54.299Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-uploader","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-uploader.git"},"author":{"name":"https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-uploader/graphs/contributors"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-uploader/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"4DT8HHZVKXEPOR8KN2UPUNVA1\"","_cached":true}
